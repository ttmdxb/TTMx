🔧 CURRENT ISSUES TO RESOLVE
Critical Issues (Must Fix Now)

Auth Store Import Error

Issue: Failed to resolve import "@/stores/auth" from "src/router/index.js"
Cause: Missing or incomplete auth store implementation
Status: Store file exists but may have export issues


Vite Configuration

Issue: Vite alias configuration incorrect
File: vite.config.ts line 11
Fix Needed: Change '@': fileURLToPath(new URL(import.meta.url)) to '@': fileURLToPath(new URL('./src', import.meta.url))


TypeScript vs JavaScript Mismatch

Issue: Project uses TypeScript but some configs may be off
Files: Both main.js and main.ts exist, causing confusion



Backend Issues

Database Seeding

Status: Admin user creation script exists but may not have run
Needed: Verify admin users are created with multi-login credentials


API Testing

Status: Backend API endpoints created but need testing
Required: Verify all authentication and order management endpoints

SMM Providers: Which providers to integrate first?


⚠ CRITICAL NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS

Never Delete Vyzor Template Files: The src/shared/components/@spk/ directory contains premium template components
TypeScript Configuration: Project is TypeScript-based, maintain type safety
Environment Variables: All secrets must be in .env files, never committed
Database Seeding: Always run user creation scripts in new environments
API Testing: Test all endpoints before frontend integration
Git Commits: Use descriptive commit messages for team clarity


📋 NEXT SESSION CHECKLIST
When resuming development:

Start Here: Fix the Vite configuration alias issue
Then: Verify auth store exports and imports
Test: Ensure both frontend and backend start without errors
Create: Admin users using the provided script
Verify: Login functionality with test credentials
Continue: Dashboard development based on user role
